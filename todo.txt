PowerMeter

TODO

* Add WiFi Config
[* Use different WiFiManager upload ... (Not ArduinoOTA) - done]
* Add to github
* Do we really need a hardware button ?
* Add restart to config html / handler ...

** How does it work? Is it only counting power pulses?
** Do we lose pulses when we report in the power?
** Is it better for the server to work out the power - and just report what we see each minute (or whatever)?
** Or better to report what we have actually see in that minute ...
** Which seems better than an instantaneous or "sampled" view ...
** We just need to be clear how much time we have measured for!
** Watch out for delays conneting to wifi etc.


** HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE MILLIS TO OVERRUN ?

*** Define params ...
